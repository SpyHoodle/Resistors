# ![Resistor Symbol](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c3/Resistor_symbol_IEC.svg) Simple Resistor Calculator
A college mini project for calculating a resistor's resistance.

## How to use
Run `python main.py`.

The program will ask you to enter 5 resistor band colors. It will then calculate the resistance and tolerance of the
resistor from the band colours that you have entered.
